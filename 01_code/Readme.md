# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 1, .NET Application ArchitecturesTo build and run the source code from Chapter 1, you need to install the .NET Core Command Line (CLI) Tools.Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows). You will find an installer for Visual Studio, and also a .NET Core SDK Installer that just includes the SDK with the command line tools. The current version of this sample is built with .NET Core RC2. When RTM is available, the sample code will be updated.For code comments and issues please check [Professional C#'s GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ProfessionalCSharp/ProfessionalCSharp6)Thank you!
